# ParadiseLostTheAdventure
A text adventure of the *Paradise Lost*, focusing on the mentality and inevitability of Satan's betrayal.  

*Paradise Lost* is the 12-book epic poem composed in blank verse by John Milton in the mid-17th century. It greatly expands on the book of *Genesis* and focuses on Satan's fall, his plans in Hell, and him eventually surveying the new Earth and the Eden where God's newest creation now lives. He spies the two humans, Adam and Eve, and aims to corrupt them. 

Highly inspired by the text adventures featured in *The Talos Principle* and its sequel, *The Talos Principle 2*. 

Developed in Godot and currently incomplete. Though I wanted to write this in C, I also wanted to be able to compile and have this be run on a variety of machines for other students to play once it is finished. Additionally, Godot has visual editing, nodes for playing audio, and greater opportunity for artistic flair for less cost.
